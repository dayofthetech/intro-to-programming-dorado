   To push the a new branch, first the 3.1 branche needed to be merge with/from whatever content
   in this case, in the terminal I make sure I was in branch 3.1
   Then I type
   git merge lesson-2-1

   Now to push 3.1 branch into github
    write a message then commit
    10/10 - I did that but nothing changed in Github, I wonder if I have to commit and sync
    or something else??

    10/11 - I will need to create a new branch lesson-4-1, I will do so through VS github extension
        * click on bottom left corner at branch
        * create a new branch from
        * name the new branch
        * select from branch, in this case lesson-3-1
        * I dont see any difference
        * write message, then commit and sync
        * when changing branches, it will ask for force checkout

    10/12 - Create a new branch lesson-4-2
        * From DTC add more DOM features to html
