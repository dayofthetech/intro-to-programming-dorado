   To push the a new branch, first the 3.1 branche needed to be merge with/from whatever content
   in this case, in the terminal I make sure I was in branch 3.1
   Then I type
   git merge lesson-2-1

   Now to push 3.1 branch into github
    write a message then commit
    10/10 - I did that but nothing changed in Github, I wonder if I have to commit and sync
    or something else??

    10/11 - I will need to create a new branch lesson-4-1, I will do so through VS github extension
        * click on bottom left corner at branch
        * create a new branch from
        * name the new branch
        * select from branch, in this case lesson-3-1
        * I dont see any difference
        * write message, then commit and sync
        * when changing branches, it will ask for force checkout

    10/12 - Create a new branch lesson-4-2
        * From DTC add more DOM features to html
        * Now working on 4-2

    10/23 - CSS style page
        * I think I should start adding more personalize content rather than following what the instructions are
        asking, even tho this might take longer to complete, right now the landing page does
        look very static.
        * I would like to add the nav bar at top and from there do like a drop page
